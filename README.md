# contextual
A proposal for a new programming language, or meta-language, designed for radical brevity plus human-readability. 

This project is bold enough to propose coding practice which some people might find scary. The radical goals of this project will not be comfortable for everyone, and we're OK with that. We're not trying to please everyone. We're trying to please programmers who are tired of having to over-explain themselves to the computer. 


# philosophy
The core philosophies of this meta-language are:
- Eliminate "machinery" in code. That is, most (all?) code today is packed with instructions to the parser/compiler, which aren't necessarily useful to the programmer, and often reduce readability. For example, punctuation. 
- Make the parser* smarter. Exploit the intelligence a parser can offer to radically reduce the programmer's effort. 
- Exploit whitespace. Imply structure with whitespace. 
- Eliminate the obvious. Depend on contextual and implication. 
- Eliminate redundancy. 
- Make the most common coding patterns part of the language, so the programmer doesn't have to spell them out every time. 

* Using the word "parser" to refer to IDE, linters, parsers, transpilers, and compilers. Anything that interprets the code. 

# progress
Current phase is **brainstorming phase.** The only activity right now is for the community to dream up better, briefer ways to write code. No work will be done on a parser, transpiler, or compiler at this time. 

# github
This is my first github project, so i'm exploring best ways to use the tools, including wiki, project, team, etc. Suggestions/tips welcomed!
